along with all dependencies

i686-w64-mingw32-gcc is the 32 bit compiler

./configure --build=i686-w64-mingw32 --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --disable-install

potential problems:
- AM_GNU_GETTEXT might be unknown, comment it out
- AM_PATH_SDL might not work, just use AC_CHECK_LIB
- SDL_mixer might need another AC_CHECK_LIB before the one setting the flags
